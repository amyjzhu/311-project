### Message from the idea maker
A professor at UBC, Margo Seltzer (who did this work at Harvard), did some work in whole-system provenance in the kernel, and what it does is trace the origin of information inside the OS. She said it would be cool to have a DSL that queries a provenance graph. Understanding the research requires a bit of ramp-up so I'm not sure how feasible it is, but it sounded like a sexy idea
